glastree 1.03 stable

Overview

  Builds live backup trees, with branches for each day.  Users directly browse
  the past to recover older documents or retrieve lost files.

  Hard links serve to compress out unchanged files, while modified ones are
  copied verbatim.  A prune utility effects a constant, sliding window.

  Satoru Takabayashi has writen a similar program, in Ruby,
  "pdumpfs":http://namazu.org/~satoru/pdumpfs.

Installation

  Edit install variables in Makefile, then 'make install' ::

    # su
    # make install

Examples

  Backup home directory to /vol02/backup ::

    # mkdir /vol02/backup
    # glastree ~ /vol02/backup

  You will subsequently see directories such as ::

     /vol02/backup/200105/26/blah/blah
     /vol02/backup/200105/27/blah/blah
     ...

  Backup my Mail files to /backup/joe/Mail (a directory I own), everyday
  at 4am, keeping last 35 days ::

    0 4 * * *  glastree Mail /backup/joe/Mail ; \
               glastreeprune --days=35 /backup/joe/Mail | xargs -- rm -fr

  As root, backup /home; user trees will be self-owned ::

    # su
    # glastree /home /backup
